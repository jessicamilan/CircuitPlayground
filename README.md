# CircuitPlayground
Arduino sketch for Adafruit's Circuit Playground Classic (ATmega32U4)

Programmed with 4 animations: 

1) Left switch side, left button - plays Happy Birthday

2) Left switch side, right button - lights up purple. In dim lighting, becomes brighter.  
To switch colors, press right button while holding any of the capacitive touch sensors. 
(It's a bit finicky: if it doesn't change right away, keep holding and pressing the button.)

3) Right switch side, left button - accelerometer animation

4) Right switch side, right button - lights react to sounds
